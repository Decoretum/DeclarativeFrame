# DeclarativeFrame

This is the repository for my guided studies, Java Declarative Framework. I had a lot of fun developing these, especially the final project. <br>
Hopefully, more MIS students will transition into Object-Oriented Programming in order to utilize systems-thinking for developing enterprise systems that bring value to the businesses.

## Warning
Code here will not be used for any monetary or commercial events. This is a guide for others willing to pursue object-oriented programming. 
This code will also not be used for plagiarism for any other MIS or CS-related projects in Ateneo de Manila University.
